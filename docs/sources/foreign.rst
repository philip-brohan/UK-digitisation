Foreign data in UK Archives
===========================

We are not interested *only* in UK observations: reconstruction of the weather in the UK benefits from observations in neighbouring countries, and understanding the weather in the UK requires both reconstruction of the weather over a much larger area and a global program of scientific collaboration. 

We cannot take on the job of digitisation for all countries, but we can provide help, particularly if the most accessible archive of a countries observations is in the NMLA.

In situations where we are collaborating with another country, most obviously through `ACRE <http://ww.met-acre.net>`_, the `Copernicus Climate Change Data Rescue Service <https://climate.copernicus.eu/data-rescue-service>`_, or one of the `Newton Fund CSSP or WCSSP projects <https://www.newtonfund.ac.uk/>`_ we could provide images or digitisation as part of our contribution.
