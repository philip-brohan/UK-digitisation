Station Registers
=================

The station registers record sub-daily (sometimes hourly) from UK (and some overseas) weather stations. These vary considerably from station to station, and over time, but are printed forms, filled out by hand, with a rich set of weather variables.

In general this data has not been digitised, some variables, for some stations, have, but only a modest fraction of the total.

   Sample station register (From the NMLA `Guide to our data collections <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/mohippo/pdf/migrated/guide_to_nma_data_collections.compressed.pdf>`_.)

This is the best UK station data, and would be the most valuable if digitised. Unfortunately it is also difficult to work with: a lot of volumes, a lot of pages, variable format, and it's manuscript. At the moment this collection is paper only (for the most part) - it has not been scanned.
