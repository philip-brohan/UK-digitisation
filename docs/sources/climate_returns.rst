Climatological Returns
======================

Not all stations produced :doc:`daily registers <registers>`. Many reported observations as a climatological return. Mostly these observations are only reported only once a day, usually at 0900.

   Sample Climatological Return (From the NMLA `Guide to our data collections <https://www.metoffice.gov.uk/binaries/content/assets/mohippo/pdf/migrated/guide_to_nma_data_collections.compressed.pdf>`_.)

Although these contain less frequent observations than the registers, they are available from more stations. NMLA have scanned the climatological returns for 1873-1956 (though they are not yet online), so they are much easier to access and handle. These records are particularly tempting if the objective is long series of daily data (as opposed to sub-daily detail).

Some of these registers have been digitised, recently through a Public Weather Service Project managed by the Met Office Observations team, and are available in MIDAS. But the majority of them remain undigitised.
