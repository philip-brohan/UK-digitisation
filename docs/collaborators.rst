Collaborators
=============

Weather observations are many people's business, and there are many people and groups, in the UK and around the world, interested in digitising more of them.

   Regional chapters of the `ACRE project <http://met-acre.net>`_

* The main community of practice in the field is the `Atmospheric Circulation Reconstructions over the Earth (ACRE) project <http://met-acre.net>`_
   - ACRE operates in part through regional chapters: Ed Hawkins, at the University of Reading, leads the 'British and Irish Isles' chapter, and is currently working on the :doc:`Daily Weather Reports <../sources/DWR>` .
* There is a research community working on digitisation as a process - efficient methods for digitising paper records of various sorts. Notable:
   - `Zooniverse <http://zooniverse.org>`_ specialise in citizen science approaches.
   - `Transkribus <https://transkribus.eu/Transkribus/>`_ are working on automated tools for handwritten text digitisation.
   - `AWS Textract <https://aws.amazon.com/textract/>`_ are building easy-to-use tools for printed document analysis.
* The `WMO <https://www.wmo.int/pages/index_en.html>`_ have an `Expert Team on Data Rescue <http://www.wmo.int/pages/prog/wcp/ccl/opace/opace1/ET-DARE-1-2.php>`_
* The `Copernicus Climate Change Service <https://climate.copernicus.eu/>`_ is supporting data rescue both through the `C3S DRS <http://ensembles-eu.metoffice.com/C3S-DR/index_C3SDR.html>`_ and `C3S GLAMOD <https://climate.copernicus.eu/node/562>`_ projects. Rescued data will be available through the `Climate Datastore <https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/#!/home>`_ and will be used in their planned long-timescale reanalysis.

Given that `ACRE <http://met-acre.net>`_ is active, effective and available, the best way to benefit from collaboration is to work with them.
