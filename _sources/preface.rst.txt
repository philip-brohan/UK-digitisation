What this is, and why
=====================

This is not a paper, or a report. Instead it borrows a standard approach from the modern software industry: it's a GitHub repository. The repository contains a collection of `reStructuredText <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ReStructuredText>`_ which can be converted, using the `Sphinx documentation generator <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sphinx_(documentation_generator)>`_, into a website or PDF document.

The advantage of this is that it is system independent, and produces a document that can be read easily offline, or online on any device. It is also versioned, so it is easy to update, and connected to a `commenting system <https://guides.github.com/features/issues/>`_ to collect reviews and corrections.

This is version 0.1.0, dated at 2019-02-13. If you have found a problem with it, or want to make a comment, please `raise an issue <https://github.com/philip-brohan/UK-digitisation/issues/new>`_.
