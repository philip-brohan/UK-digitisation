Conclusions and recommendations
===============================

* Data rescue is a necessary part of Met Office activity, both as part of our responsibility as the public memory of the weather, and to support scientific and other projects.
* Long observational records are an area where the UK could be world-leading. We should aim not only to be seen as the best in the world, but also to encourage research on UK climate (as opposed to other regions).
* The long-term aim should be to digitise everything. Current customers are mostly dataset-builders, and there are already enough of those to generate a use-case for almost every observation. The customer requirements for digital data are likely to grow as data science and machine learning expand further.
* As there are already requirements for many duifferent sets of observations, short term focus should be pragmatic:
   - What's easy
   - What's externally resourced
   - What's at risk
   - What do we already have a customer and a database for.

* Data rescue is not a activity unique to the UK or the Met Office. We should engage more actively with European and international projects in archive work, data rescue methods, and distribution of digitised observations.
