Consequences
============

<<<<<<< HEAD
The job is not done when the data is transcribed:

* Metadata for the observations (station locations, instrument types, observation times, ...) must also be found.
* The transcribed observations must be converted to a standardised, machine readable form, and uploaded to the relevant national and international databases.
* The new observations will need quality control.
* A process for updating the observations will be needed, when errors are found or additional data are provided.
* The observations may require homogenisation to make them compatable with related observations.
* A maintenance process will be needed - who will assign and change access permissions, authorise use, certify accuracy, respond to criticisms or corrections?
